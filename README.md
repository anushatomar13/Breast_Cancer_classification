# Breast_Cancer_classification
This project implements a predictive model for breast cancer using Logistic Regression and provides interactive visualization of the Breast Cancer dataset. The dataset is obtained from the Scikit-learn library and contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
